            <p>The Learning Analytics approach adopted in education implies the gathering and processing of sensitive 
                information and the generation of profiles of students, which may have direct or indirect dire consequences 
                for the students. The Educational institutions must manage this data processing according to the General 
                Data Protection Regulation, respecting its principles of fairness when it comes to information gathering and 
                processing. This implies that the students must be well informed and give explicit consent before their 
                information is gathered and processed. The GDPR propose the usage of recognizable standardized icons to 
                facilitate a general understanding and awareness of how personal data is deemed to be processed in each 
                application context, like an online course. This paper presents a project that aims to provide a set of 
                icons to inform about the treatment of educational data in the Learning Analytics processes and a survey 
                about the student's comprehension of the icons, their meaning, and implications for their privacy and 
                confidentiality. The result presented is a set of icons ready to be integrated into educational environments 
                that apply Learning Analytics to increase transparency and facilitate the understanding of data processing.
            </p>
            <p>
                The learning processes mediated by Learning Analytics collect data of all possible student interactions and 
                academic performance, both treated as students' behaviors. At the same time, data collection goes beyond what 
                is strictly educational or academic. This additional data, considered as metadata, are complementary and may 
                originate from heterogeneous sources such as social networks or financial data. All this data and metadata 
                collection generate a sensitive context making data fragile in all senses. Consequently, concerns arise 
                regarding confidentiality, privacy, and security of the students' data and, in it extends, about their 
                digital identity. <br>
                The use of Learning Analytics implies a great responsibility regarding the collection, storage, treatment, 
                and sharing of educational data, especially when the data is from minors.
            </p>
            <p>
                Considering the above and the educational context, fast, transparent, and easy to understand forms of 
                information are required to: <br>
                    • Raise awareness of current student data treatment processes in any educational context. <br>
                    • Let the students know how their data is treated and for what purpose, preferably previous registration 
                    to any course. <br>
                    • Establish a standardized information system and transmission medium in any educational context for 
                    obvious reasons.
            </p>
            <p>
                Recital 60 of the GPDR informs about the possibility of using standardized icons to combine with textual 
                information. The purpose of the complementary use of standardized icons is to give a clear, intelligible, 
                and legible view of the intended processing. <br>
                The use of the icons can fulfill the three points of the previous section. Icons can inform how the data 
                is processed in Learning Analytics and, therefore, generate awareness to students by facilitating access to 
                this type of information. Consequently, we propose as objectives of the study: <br>
                    • Design descriptive icons of those parts of the Learning Analytics processes that must be reported to 
                    students, and that other authors have not designed in their work. <br>
                    • Develop and make available a tool such as Creative Commons where any VLE administrator can create the 
                    appropriate icon packs to inform students of the different treatments of their data from the LMS itself.
